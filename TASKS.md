# Tasks

## Functionality
These tasks are related to creating new functionality for the end-user.

- [ ] Create an UI (GUI? TUI?)
- [ ] Hide the A* algorithm solver behind a feature flag, as well as the relevant dependencies


## Internal
These tasks affect internal code refactors and other things that shouldn't affect the user's experience.

- [ ] Start using the X coordinates for the horizontal axis, and the Y coordinates for the vertical one (it's now the opposite)
- [ ] Add ratatui as a dependency
- [ ] Add versioning?
